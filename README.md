**Lighter** â€“ is the app to control [LIFX light strip](https://www.lifx.com/pages/light-strips) and others remotely over internet. During 2020 COVID pandemic I was stuck in self isolation quarantine in hotel before travelling to work and it happened over the New Years Eve. To have some kind of interaction and celebration with my family and friends I made this app and had colorful lights set up in my room. App has UI interface to set different colors, scenes and effects on the light. Friends would access it and make choices to send me vibes and emotions. There are different colors, combination of themes as XMAS, LOVE, HOLIDAY, EXCITING etc. Effects as CHIN-CHIN would cause lights flashing and I would know that somebody is having a cheers drink.

Frontend app is built using [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to populate buttons. 

Backend server built using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and running [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server to add user API Key and proxy requests to LIFX light API, this would hide API key to keep it private.
App also can be used during zoom meetings where other user can change background lighting of his companion.
